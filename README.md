# Enigma
# Python code to replicate enigma model K machine.
# Code contained in .py file. 


# The python code is made to replicate the enigma model K machine, the 3 rotors have been programmed as follows
#        rotor1 = "LPGSZMHAEOQKVXRFYBUTNICJDW"
#        rotor2 = "SLVGBTFXJQOHEWIRZYAMKPCNDU"
#        rotor3 = "CJGDPSHKTURAWZXFMYNQOBVLIE"

# Reflector Programming

      
#       reflector_map = "IMETCGFRAYSQBZXWLHKDVUPOJN"


# USAGE

# 1. Enter the rotor values as a letter from A to Z (repeat for all three rotors)
# 2. Enter and plugboard values or press enter to skip. Plugboard values can be entered as follows A=K,L=R,P=B etc.
# 3. Select option 1 to enter text. Text can be entered with spaces, these will be striped as there was no space bar on the original machine.
# 4. The output wil be displayed without spaces.
# 5. Select option 3 to display output in four letter groups, in line with what was used during WW2.
# 6. Select option 0 to exit program.



# Future enhancements:
# 1. the order of the rotors should be able to be altered.
# 2. The Reflector map should also have 26 options rather than the one used in this code.

# cheers,

# Liam
